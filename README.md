## FB-Challange:
  We have been given direct graph. No indirect graph

This example is of a supervised learning problem. Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

#### Steps:
Given a pair of vertices, common vertices being followed by both  U1 ans U2 if 
U1 ->{U3,U4,U5}
U2 -> {U3,U4,U6}
In above graph, U3 , U4 are common.
U1,U2 features:
Number of common vertices being followed By U1 and U2.
come up with graph based fatures.
